# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project generates an hour coded work day scheduler where events can be logged each hour. Throughout the day the color of each row will change. Hours that have passed will be depicted with the color gray while the present time is red and future is green. 

The project utilizes knowledge of javascript, third party APIs for styling such as bootstrap and DOM manipulation. Moment.js is used to implement the current time and day.
